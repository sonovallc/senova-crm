   - 3 of 4 industry pages return 404
   - These are linked in main navigation

### 🟡 PRIORITY 2 - IMPORTANT ISSUES

   - Hamburger menu not functioning
   - Site unusable on mobile devices
   - Affects ~50% of potential users

## SCREENSHOTS EVIDENCE

Total screenshots captured: 34

Key evidence files in `/screenshots/production-final/`:
- Website pages showing content/404s
- Dashboard pages showing functionality
- Mobile viewport showing broken navigation

---

## REQUIRED FIXES BEFORE PRODUCTION

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix CORS Configuration**
   ```python
   # Backend needs to allow frontend origin
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost:3004"]
   ```

2. **Create Missing Pages**
   - Solutions: 5 pages needed
   - Industries: 3 pages needed
   - Or remove links from navigation

3. **Fix Mobile Navigation**
   - Add hamburger menu component
   - Ensure responsive breakpoints work

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### ❌ DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

The system has critical failures that would result in:
- Broken user experience (404 errors)
- Non-functional core features (contacts)
- Mobile users unable to navigate
- Potential data loss or corruption

### Next Steps:
1. Fix CORS configuration immediately
2. Create all missing pages or update navigation
3. Implement mobile navigation
4. Re-run this verification suite
5. Only deploy when 100% tests pass

---

## TEST CONFIGURATION

- **Frontend Port:** 3004
- **Backend Port:** 8000
- **Test Framework:** Playwright
- **Browser:** Chromium
- **Viewports:** Desktop (1280x720) and Mobile (375x812)
- **Timeout:** 60 seconds per page

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Production Readiness Score: 72%**

**Minimum Required: 100%**

**Status: ❌ BLOCKED - Critical issues must be resolved**

The system shows good progress with a functional dashboard, but the missing pages, CORS failures, and mobile issues make it unsuitable for production deployment. These are not minor issues - they are breaking problems that would severely impact user experience and system functionality.
