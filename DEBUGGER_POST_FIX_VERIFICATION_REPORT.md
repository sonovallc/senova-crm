## 🔍 CONSOLE ERRORS

Total Errors: 2

- **About:** Encountered two children with the same key, `%s`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version. Compliant
- **Aesthetic Clinics:** Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

## 🏁 PRODUCTION READINESS


### ⚠️ SYSTEM IS NEARLY PRODUCTION READY

The system is close but needs attention:
- Dashboard navigation needs work


**Recommendation:** Fix remaining issues before production deployment.
