# Contact Edit Issue Analysis

## Problem
UI shows 'Contact updated successfully' but database has original values.

## Root Cause
Backend filters out phones, addresses, websites fields silently at line 800 in contacts.py:

    if field not in allowed_fields:
        continue  # SKIPS THE FIELD!

## Why
core_editable_fields set (lines 747-752) is missing these three fields:
- phones
- addresses  
- websites

## Fix
Add these three to core_editable_fields set in backend/app/api/v1/contacts.py

## Impact
- Frontend sends phones/addresses/websites to backend
- Backend silently filters them out
- Database never updated
- Frontend shows success toast anyway
- User sees no changes
