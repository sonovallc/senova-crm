# SENOVA DEBUG - VISUAL EVIDENCE SUMMARY

## Screenshot Analysis (01-home-full.png)

### Confirmed Issues:

1. **WRONG PRODUCT ENTIRELY**
   - Page shows "Turn 80% of Your Website Visitors Into Booked Appointments"
   - This is NOT a medical aesthetics CRM
   - This appears to be a website visitor tracking tool

2. **Forbidden Content Present:**
   - "80%" claim in main headline
   - "60%" claim
   - "3X" conversion claim
   - "$50,000 Every Month" revenue claim

3. **Product Mismatch:**
   - Shows "Patient Identification Pixel", "Audience Builder", "Follow Up Campaigns"
   - These are NOT CRM features for medical aesthetics practices
   - This is a lead generation/marketing tool, not a practice management CRM

4. **Target Audience Mismatch:**
   - Shows generic "Medical Spas", "Dermatology", "Plastic Surgery", "Aesthetic Clinics"
   - But the product is about website visitor tracking, not CRM

5. **Content Issues:**
   - "SOC 2 Certified" visible (should be "SOC 2 Compliant")
   - Specific percentage claims and guarantees throughout

## Critical Finding:

**The entire website is showing the WRONG PRODUCT.** This is not displaying as a CRM for medical aesthetics practices. Instead, it's showing as a website visitor identification and marketing tool.

This explains why:
- The login page is broken (probably looking for CRM interface)
- 70% of pages are returning errors
- The content doesn't match CRM functionality

## Recommendation:

The website needs to be completely rebuilt or the correct CRM product needs to be deployed. The current site is not the Senova CRM for medical aesthetics practices - it's showing a completely different product focused on website visitor tracking and lead generation.
