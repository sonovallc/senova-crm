TESTER STUCK REPORT - BUG-1 INBOX UNREAD STATUS

PROBLEM:
Unable to execute Playwright test to reproduce BUG-1. Multiple issues encountered:

1. Test script creation failing with bash syntax errors when trying to create inline node scripts
2. When running existing test templates, getting timeout on password field fill
3. Frontend appears to be running (HTTP 307/200) but Playwright can't interact with login form
4. Root URL redirects to /home (public website), need to test /login -> /dashboard/inbox flow

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
- Created test script using various methods (heredoc, node -e, copying templates)
- Tried increasing timeouts to 90000ms
- Verified frontend is running with curl
- Found that root redirects to /home instead of login

WHAT I NEED:
1. Confirmation that CRM login is at http://localhost:3004/login (not /home)
2. Working Playwright test script or alternative method to:
   - Login to CRM
   - Navigate to inbox
   - Click a thread
   - Verify read/unread status changes
   - Take screenshots as evidence

3. Or: Should I skip automated testing and request manual verification of BUG-1?

BLOCKER:
Cannot reproduce bug without working test automation. Need human guidance on how to proceed with BUG-1 verification.
