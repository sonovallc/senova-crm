STUCK AGENT ESCALATION - BUG-INBOX-FILTERS

ISSUE: Backend Missing Archived Support
========================================

TASK: Add "Read" and "Archived" filter options to Inbox page

PROBLEM DISCOVERED:
- The Communication model has NO 'archived' field or status
- Current CommunicationStatus enum values: PENDING, SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED, READ
- There is no backend support for archiving emails

FILE LOCATIONS:
- Frontend: context-engineering-intro/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/inbox/page.tsx (lines 309-350)
- Backend Model: context-engineering-intro/backend/app/models/communication.py (lines 28-34)

CURRENT FILTER IMPLEMENTATION:
- Lines 309-319: Three tabs defined (All, Unread, Pending)
- Line 338: Unread filter: conversations.filter((c) => c.status !== 'read')
- Line 346: Pending filter: conversations.filter((c) => c.status === 'pending')

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:

Option 1: Partial Implementation (Read only)
- Add "Read" filter (works with existing status)
- Skip "Archived" filter (would require backend changes)
- PRO: Deliverable immediately, no breaking changes
- CON: Does not fully satisfy bug requirements

Option 2: Full Implementation with Placeholder
- Add "Read" filter (functional)
- Add "Archived" filter (shows empty results with note)
- PRO: UI complete, sets expectation for future feature
- CON: Archived filter non-functional until backend updated

Option 3: Request Backend Changes First
- Add 'archived' status to CommunicationStatus enum
- Add database migration
- Update API endpoints to support archived filter
- Then implement frontend filters
- PRO: Complete solution
- CON: Requires backend changes, more time

HUMAN DECISION NEEDED:
Which option should I proceed with?

CONTEXT: This is for production CRM system. Bug severity: Medium.
