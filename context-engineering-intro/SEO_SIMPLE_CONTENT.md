- What websites they visit
- What they search for online
- What they've bought before
- Where they live and work

**Your Ads Follow Them (Respectfully)**
When someone visits your website but doesn't buy, our platform can show them special offers as they browse other sites. It's a gentle reminder that brings them back when they're ready.

**You See Everything**
Unlike agencies that give you vague reports, you see exactly:
- Where your ads appeared

- How much each new customer cost

#### Real Business Examples
